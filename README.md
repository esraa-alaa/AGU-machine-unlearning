# AGU-machine-unlearning
Python code to implement the Adaptive Gradient Unlearning (AGU) algorithm using PyTorch. This code focuses on the unlearning process for specified data points while retaining model performance on the remaining dataset.
Dependencies:
Ensure torch, pandas, and scikit-learn are installed.
Execution:
Save and run the script in a Python environment with GPU support for faster training.
Customization:
Modify the forget_indices logic to target other subsets of the dataset for unlearning.
